      "description": "Amorfs are gelatinous, sentient beings with semi-translucent bodies that change color and texture based on their diet. Their distributed intelligence allows them to alter their form, navigate narrow spaces, and even split into smaller versions of themselves. Intensely curious, Amorfs constantly seek new experiences and rapidly adapt, absorbing knowledge through interaction and reproduction. They embrace novelty, reevaluating beliefs and learning from their surroundings. Amorfs integrate technology directly into their bodies, where it floats within their gel-like form. Their fluid, expressive appearance and openness to new ideas make them one of the galaxy’s most dynamic species.",

      "description": "Calxis are sentient beings of living rock, with intricate crystalline networks functioning as their neural systems. They excel in holistic thinking and pattern recognition, preferring intuitive leaps over linear analysis. Unable to reproduce off their homeworld, Calxis are rare, journeying back to carve offspring from their own bodies. They communicate through intricate light displays across a range of wavelengths, as they cannot hear. Renowned for their mastery of fusion technology, they are key to powering galactic devices and mining operations. Calxis bring a methodical, community-centered perspective, embodying stability and insight in an ever-changing galaxy.",

      "description": "Feararcs are semiaquatic hunters from icy, water-rich planets, standing about six feet tall with muscular bodies and camouflage-adaptive fur. Their fur seals for swimming or splits to trap heat on land, allowing them to blend seamlessly with cold environments. Feararcs are primarily solitary, exhibiting intelligence, patience, and highly strategic thinking in their hunts. Though they lack advanced technology, they sometimes explore the galaxy out of curiosity. Many Feararcs choose self-exile, preferring the freedom of solitude. Skilled in survival and analysis, Feararcs find balance between their instincts and a cautious curiosity about the universe.",

God-trees are masters of genetic manipulation, creating biotech wonders like starships, bioluminescent lights, and woven bio-roads, though they remain rooted in place. The Stock, adaptable in form, move freely and maintain ecosystems, worshiping the god-trees as sacred entities. Flora society embodies unity and ecological harmony, extending across star systems in a vast territory called the “Pantheon.” Each god-tree’s values shape the communities under its influence, and the Flora’s deep commitment to sustainability and symbiosis defines their interstellar reputation.",

While other species come in a range of vibrant colors, humans are only found in shades of brown. This is particularly odd because they possess some of the most advanced color vision in the galaxy, surpassed only by the Calxis. Originating mostly from corporate-controlled star systems, humans balance individuality with corporate influence. Resourceful and quick to adapt, humans form alliances easily and are skilled at navigating interspecies complexities.",

They’re known for creating advanced technology, including Grav Drives and Ether systems, and for their philosophical diversity. Some, like “Flawed Machina,” embrace imperfection, while others, like “One-Body Machina,” believe in a single inseparable physical form. Despite their technological superiority, Machina face complex relationships with humans, balancing a deep-rooted history of servitude with their hard-won independence.",

For Warriors and Royals, the upper pair of arms are blade-like appendages extending from their shoulders; in Drones, they are vestigial wings; in Laborers, these extra arms, called tool-arms, are specialized for tasks like lifting and building. Vearin prioritize hive welfare above individuality, using chemical signals and sound for communication. If a hive’s Royals are lost, the remaining “hiveless” Vearin form “found-hives” with other species, carrying their strong loyalty to these new groups.",
